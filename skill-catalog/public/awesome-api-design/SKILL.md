description: "Designs or reviews the shape of an HTTP API before code exists — resources, versioning, pagination, idempotency, filtering, and where the error contract plugs in. Use when asked to design or review an API, decide versioning or pagination, add an endpoint at the design stage, 'спроектируй API', or when awesome-design-doc needs the contract detailed. Do not use for the error envelope itself (awesome-error-standards), vulnerability review of handlers (awesome-security-audit), or auditing an implemented architecture (awesome-architecture-audit)."

# API Design

Shape an HTTP API so its consumers can build against it for years without a breaking surprise. The contract is the product: URLs, methods, payloads, errors, and evolution rules are decided here, deliberately — everything left implicit becomes an accidental contract the first client depends on.

## When to Activate

- "Design the API for X", "review this API design / OpenAPI spec", "how should we version / paginate / handle retries".
- A design doc needs its API section made concrete (awesome-design-doc hands off here).
- A new endpoint is being added to an existing API and must match its conventions.

Do not activate to define the error envelope's fields or retry classification (awesome-error-standards owns that contract) or to audit implemented handlers for vulnerabilities (awesome-security-audit).

## Work Process

1. Inventory the incumbent conventions and the project's own words — an existing API's casing, id format, pagination style, and envelope win over any guideline here: consistency within one API beats global best practice. Only a new API starts from the defaults below. Read the recorded decisions (existing ADRs) and the project's glossary (`CONTEXT.md`, a domain doc, or the terms its code and tests already use) before naming a single resource: a path is a public, long-lived name, and one that renames a concept the codebase already has costs every reader a translation.
2. Model resources, not procedures — nouns with identity and lifecycle (`/orders/{id}`), actions as state transitions on them (`POST /orders/{id}/cancel` when a pure verb is unavoidable — never `/doCancelOrder`). Nest at most one level deep; deeper hierarchies become query filters (`/comments?post_id=…`), because every nesting level hardcodes an ownership assumption into every client URL.
3. Decide the evolution rules before v1 ships — additive changes (new optional field, new endpoint) go in place; anything breaking (remove/rename/retype a field, tighten validation) only ever creates a new version. Publish that taxonomy with the API so consumers know what is safe to ignore. Evolve by layering — a redesigned abstraction ships beside the old one and existing integrations keep working until their owners move; deprecation is announced with a sunset window, never enforced by an in-place change.
4. Design list endpoints for growth — opaque cursor pagination (encode the `(sort_key, id)` position, return `has_more` + `next_cursor` in a list envelope) over offset, which skips and duplicates rows under concurrent writes and dies on deep pages. Filtering and sorting are an allowlist of named parameters over indexed fields, never a pass-through to the query layer.
5. Make unsafe methods retry-safe — mutations accept an `Idempotency-Key`; same key + same body replays the stored response, same key + different body is 409. Without it, every client retry is a potential duplicate side effect. (Retry classification and the envelope format: awesome-error-standards.)
6. Specify concurrency and partial updates — updates that can conflict get optimistic concurrency (`ETag` + `If-Match`, 409 with the current version on mismatch); PATCH semantics are declared (merge-patch vs replace), and an empty PATCH is rejected, not silently a no-op.
7. Write the contract down as the source of truth — an OpenAPI/schema document that generates or validates the implementation, not prose that drifts from it. Ids are opaque and prefixed (`ord_…`), timestamps ISO 8601 UTC, money integer minor units with currency, enums closed with a documented default for unknown values on the consumer side.

## Design review checklist

When reviewing an existing design, walk the same decisions as findings:

- Naming and casing consistent across every endpoint; no mixed `camelCase`/`snake_case` payloads.
- No verbs in resource paths except modeled state transitions; no RPC-style `/getX` endpoints beside REST resources.
- Every list endpoint paginated from day one — retrofitting pagination is a breaking change.
- Every mutation idempotent-by-key or documented as naturally idempotent.
- Error responses reference one stable envelope (awesome-error-standards) — not per-endpoint improvisation.
- Versioning and deprecation policy stated; no "we'll decide when we break something".
- Webhooks the API sends are treated as public surface: signed, versioned, redeliverable — same contract discipline as endpoints.
- Nothing in the response a client shouldn't see: internal ids, flags, or fields leaking through by serializer default.

## Output Format

```text
API Design — <scope> — <date>

Contract decisions:
- <area: resources | versioning | pagination | idempotency | concurrency> — <decision> — <the consumer consequence it buys>
...

Spec: <OpenAPI/schema skeleton or diff, when producing one>
Deviations from incumbent conventions: <each with its justification, or "none">
Open questions: <decisions needing the user, with a recommended default each>
```

## Self-check before delivering

- Run the design review checklist above against your own output — a finding in your own design gets fixed before delivery, not shipped with a caveat.
- Every contract decision names the consumer consequence it buys; "because best practice" is not a justification — delete or justify.
- Step 1 has evidence: name the incumbent spec, routes, or client code actually inspected. Defaults applied to an API that has conventions is the failure mode.
- Every mutation in the design answers the retry question (idempotency key or naturally idempotent — stated which); every list endpoint answers the growth question.
- Each open question carries a recommended default; a bare question pushes the design work back to the reader.

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Instead |
|---|---|
| Offset pagination on a growing table | Opaque cursor over an indexed sort key |
| Breaking change hidden as a "fix" | New version; the old shape never changes under a client |
| Per-endpoint error shapes | One envelope, one shared client-side parser |
| Sequential integer ids in URLs | Opaque prefixed ids; sequence leaks volume and invites enumeration |
| `PUT` that silently drops unknown fields | Declared PATCH semantics; strict validation with named rejections |
| Prose spec that trails the implementation | Machine-readable contract that generates or gates the code |
| Designing for the first client's screen | Resources model the domain; view composition belongs to the client |
