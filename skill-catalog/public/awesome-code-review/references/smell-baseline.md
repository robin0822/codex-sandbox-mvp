# Smell baseline

The fixed set of design smells the Standards axis carries even when a repository documents no conventions of its own. Catalogued in Martin Fowler's _Refactoring_ (2nd ed., ch. 3); the phrasing here is compressed to what a reviewer needs at the diff.

Two rules bind the whole list:

- The repository overrides. A documented standard always wins. Where the repo endorses something this list would flag (a deliberate Middle Man in an anti-corruption layer, primitives everywhere in a hot path), suppress the smell rather than arguing with the house style.
- Every entry is a heuristic, never a violation. Report it as "possible Feature Envy here", with the hunk quoted, and let the author disagree. A smell is a reason to look, not a verdict. Skip anything a linter or type-checker already enforces — a review that repeats tooling wastes the round.

Each smell reads *what it is on this diff* → *the direction of the fix*.

| Smell | What it looks like in the diff | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|
| Mysterious Name | A function, variable or type whose name does not say what it does or holds | Rename it; if no honest name comes, the design under it is murky |
| Duplicated Code | The same logic shape in more than one hunk or file of this change | Extract the shape once, call it from both sites |
| Long Function | A function that has grown past the point where its steps read as one idea | Extract the steps that have their own names; guard clauses over nesting |
| Long Parameter List | Parameters accumulating on a call the change touches | Bundle the ones that travel together into a type, or pass the object that already holds them |
| Feature Envy | A method reaching into another object's data more than its own | Move the method onto the data it envies |
| Data Clumps | The same few fields or parameters keep travelling together — a type wanting to be born | Bundle them into one type and pass that |
| Primitive Obsession | A string or number standing in for a domain concept with its own rules (money, ids, units) | Give the concept a small type of its own |
| Repeated Switches | The same `switch` or `if`-cascade on the same type recurring across the change | Polymorphism, or one map both sites read |
| Shotgun Surgery | One logical change forcing scattered edits across many files in this diff | Gather what changes together into one module |
| Divergent Change | One file edited in this diff for several unrelated reasons | Split it so each module changes for one reason |
| Speculative Generality | Abstraction, parameters or hooks added for needs the spec does not have | Delete it; inline back until a real second caller shows up |
| Message Chains | Long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller should not depend on | Hide the walk behind one method on the first object |
| Middle Man | A class or function that mostly delegates onward | Cut it; call the real target directly |
| Insider Trading | Two modules trading private detail through a back channel | Move the shared thing to one owner, or introduce an explicit interface |
| Refused Bequest | A subclass or implementer ignoring or overriding most of what it inherits | Drop the inheritance; use composition |
| Comments as deodorant | A comment explaining what a confusing block does | Rename or extract until the comment is unnecessary; keep comments for *why* |

## Which of these belong in the review

- Only where the diff creates or worsens them. A smell that already lived in the file and is untouched by the change is a note at most; demanding its cleanup inside an unrelated PR is scope creep with a citation attached.
- Ranked with everything else. These compete for the round's five to seven slots against correctness and security findings, and they usually lose. One structural smell that explains several others is worth reporting; a list of twelve is a wall the author will scroll past.
- With a location and a direction. "Possible Data Clumps at `orders.ts:88` — `userId, tenantId, locale` travel together through four signatures in this diff; a `RequestContext` type would carry them" is actionable. "This could be cleaner" is not.
